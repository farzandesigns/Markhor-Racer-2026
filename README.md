# Markhor-Racer-2026 
This project focuses on designing a STEMS based Formula In Schools Car. The project gives a baseline to design your own car, what results to achieve, what CAD and CAA techniques to use and what results to include.

📦Technologies / Resources
------------------------------
* `Traditional Drafting`
* `SOLIDWORKS`
* `SOLIDWORKS Flow Simulaion`
* `Testing Library`
* `Onshape`
* `Blender`
* `CNC `

⚙Features 
--------------
* __Airflow:__  Includes both laminar and turbulent airflow

   
* __Controll Surfaces:__  Rear and Front wings help stick the car to the ground

  
* __Propultion System:__  CO<sub>2

⏳Process
---------------------
1. Define Requirements

    Decide the type of car, materials, dimensions, and performance goals. This will guide your design in SolidWorks.

2. Design the Chassis

    Start a new part, sketch the side profile, and use Extrude or Loft to create the 3D chassis. Add cutouts or supports to reduce weight.

3. Design Wheels & Suspension

    Create wheels by sketching circles and extruding them. Design arms as rods with hinge points to connect the wheels to the chasis. 

4. Assemble the Car

    Open a new assembly and insert all parts. Use mates to connect components, like concentric for axles or coincident for surfaces.

5. Apply Materials

    Assign realistic materials for accurate simulation. Example: aluminum for chassis, steel for suspension, rubber for tires.

6. Run Simulations

    Use SolidWorks Simulation to test your car. Start with static analysis to check stress and deformation. Optional: use motion analysis to test wheel rotation and suspension movement.

7. Refine the Design

    Lighten the chassis, reinforce high-stress areas, and adjust wheelbase or suspension for stability.

8. Document the Project

    Make 2D drawings of all parts and save simulation results. You can also render a realistic image of your car.

🔎What I Learned
------------------------
Sometimes traditional approaches fail always think out of the box.

Complex systems can break focus on simpler more reliable designs.

Make more than one versions test different things on different versions apply what you learned from all into the final project
